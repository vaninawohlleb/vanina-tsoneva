          <p>As a developer on VICE's Viceland team, I was responsible for the front end implementation of features planned for the launch. These included small modules, such as the front page carousel, but also bigger changes and features. Viceland's launch was part of the unification of all VICE's verticals, which included rewriting all front end apps into React.js and making the code base reusable between verticals. This way we could have new features and bug fixes implemented through  the whole system, instead of implementing them one by one for each vertical. Tech: React.js

          <p>As a team lead for the launch of Broadly I was responsible for making sure the final edits on design and
            functionality are implemented just before the official launch. This meant development, but also assisting in deploys,
            code reviews, and feature prioritization. Broadly's launch was one of the last launches on the Laravel CMS,
            and just before we started the unification process. Its front end look and feel were very different than all
            other verticals, and included implementing features for a very first time. Tech: Laravel, Vue.js, Stylus.
